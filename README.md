## Project Overview
cnctd.ai is a full-stack web application designed for secure and scalable deployment. The backend, built with Node.js and Express, handles the API logic and authentication, while the frontend, built with React.js, provides a modern, responsive user interface.

The project utilizes JWT for secure authentication, Docker for containerization, and GitHub Actions for CI/CD. The platform follows a security-first approach with various tools for vulnerability scanning and monitoring.

## Features
JWT-based Authentication: Secure token-based user authentication.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Different user roles with restricted access to resources.
RESTful API: API endpoints built with Express for secure and scalable interactions.
Responsive Frontend: Built with React.js for a fast, interactive UI.
CI/CD Automation: GitHub Actions for automated testing, building, and deployment.
Security Auditing: npm audit for dependency vulnerability scanning and Docker image security checks.
Containerization: Docker support for easy deployment and scaling.

## Tech Stack
### Backend:
* Node.js with Express: Backend framework for building REST APIs.
* PostgreSQL: Relational database for data storage (or replace with MySQL if needed).
* JWT: Token-based authentication.
* bcrypt: For secure password hashing.
* Helmet.js: To set security-related HTTP headers.
* Winston: Logging library.

### Frontend:
* React.js: For building the user interface.
* Axios: For making HTTP requests to the backend API.
* React Router: For client-side routing.
* Styled Components / Tailwind CSS: For styling (depending on your design approach).

### DevOps:
* Docker: Containerization of the backend and frontend.
* GitHub Actions: For continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD).
* Nginx: (Optional) For reverse proxy and serving static files in production.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
Before setting up the project, ensure that you have the following installed:

* Node.js (v16 or higher)
* npm or yarn
* Docker (if running with Docker)
* Git

### Backend Setup
#### 1. Clone the repository:
* git clone https://github.com/xtonyknucklesx/cnctd.git
* cd cnctd/backend

#### 2. Install dependencies:
* npm install

#### 3. Environment Variables: Create an *.env* file in the *backend/* directory and add the following environment variables:
* PORT=3000
* JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
* DB_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/your_db_name

#### 4. Run the backend server:
* npm run dev

### Frontend Setup
#### 1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
* cd ../frontend

#### 2. Install frontend dependencies:
* npm install

#### 3. Run the frontend app:
* npm start

## Running the Application
### Locally
#### 1. Run the backend:
From the *backend/* directory, run: npm run dev

#### 2. Run the frontend:

From the *frontend/* directory, run: npm start

#### 3. The backend will be running on *http://localhost:8000*, and the frontend will be available on *http://localhost:3000*.

### With Docker
#### 1. Build the Docker images for both backend and frontend:

* Backend: docker build -t cnctd-ai-backend ./backend
* Frontend: docker build -t cnctd-ai-frontend ./frontend
#### 2. Run the containers:

* Backend: docker run -p 8000:8000 cnctd-backend
* Frontend: docker run -p 3000:3000 cnctd-frontend

## CI/CD Pipeline
### GitHub Actions
cnctd.ai uses **GitHub Actions** for continuous integration and deployment. The pipeline is triggered on every push to the *main* branch.

The CI/CD pipeline includes:

* **Build:** Automatically builds the backend and frontend.
* **Test:** Runs unit tests and lints code.
* **Docker Image Creation:** Builds and pushes Docker images to DockerHub or another registry.
* **Deployment:** Optionally, deploys to production on successful builds.

### Pipeline Configuration
The configuration file *.github/workflows/ci.yml* contains the steps to build, test, and deploy the project.

## Security
**cnctd.ai** is built with security in mind. Below are the security measures in place:

* **JWT Authentication:** User authentication is handled via JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
* **Password Hashing:** All passwords are hashed using bcrypt.
* **Helmet.js:** Used to set various HTTP headers for security.
* **npm audit:** Automatically scans for vulnerabilities in npm dependencies.
* **Docker Image Scanning:** Images are scanned for vulnerabilities using tools like Trivy.
* **Environment Variables:** Sensitive information like secrets are stored in environment variables.
